**CHURN PREDICTION USING MULTI-LAYER PERCEPTRON**

- A Simple Deep Learning approach to predict Churn
- A Binary Classification Problem
- Parameters that suit Binary Classification are taken - Layers, Activation Functions, Loss Functions, Optimizers, and Evaluation Metrics.
- Hyperparameter tuning has been done to differentiate the Performance before and after.
